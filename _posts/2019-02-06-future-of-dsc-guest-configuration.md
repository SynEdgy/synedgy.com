<h1>The Future of DSC - Introducing Azure Guest Configuration</h1>

Across the community and its different channels, I found many people struggling to decrypt Microsoft's position around
Desired State Configuration (on-prem or Azure), its future, and Configuration Management on Windows.
As a Configuration Management specialist, I make a point to follow and analyse this area closely, and will share my thinking below.

<h2>Some Context</h2>

Although I recommend getting [The DSC Book](https://leanpub.com/the-dsc-book) by [Don Jones](https://twitter.com/concentrateddon) and [Melissa Januszko](https://twitter.com/thedevopsdiva) to quickly learn all you need to know how to be proficient with DSC, or [Ravikanth Chaganti](https://twitter.com/ravikanth)'s [Pro PowerShell Desired State Configuration](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484234822) for going further, here's just enough context to understand how things are evolving.

The first version of DSC was released as part of the Windows Management Framework 4 (WMF4) in 2013, then had a couple of
minor updates via Windows Updates, before another version coming with WMF 5 and properly released (fixed) in 5.1 (2016), introducing
some new features.

The DSC components, at a high level are:
1. the Domain Specific Language (DSL) & Commands
2. the Local Configuration Manager (one for Windows & one for Linux)
3. the Pull Server & the Report server
4. the DSC resources

And this is what they do:
1. The DSL is what allows us to use the Declarative Syntax within PowerShell to define the configuration policy of your systems, and compiles into MOF Documents.
2. The LCM is the agent what enacts those MOF documents, whether on demand or periodically when using the Pull model.
3. The pull server is a glorified File server that implements the [MS-DSCPM protocol](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn393548.aspx) to talk to the LCM.
    The Report server is a data collector aggregating the results of each DSC runs in its database.
4. The DSC resources are some sorts of interfaces enabling idempotent characteristics to scripts configuring atomic resources, or a composition of different resources.
The most popular are written for the Windows LCM supporting PowerShell 5.1, but some exists for Linux and can be written in [Python or pretty much any language](https://www.powershellmagazine.com/2015/02/26/working-with-powershell-dsc-for-linux-part-4/).


<h2>Tightly coupled legacy</h2>

What needs the more improvements is the LCM, but the current version was released as part of WMF 5.1 for Windows, and a whole different code base for Linux. It was also built atop WMI, hence the MOF format used for compiled configurations.
Let's be clear, don't expect a new version of WMF coming, only security patches. Afterall, PowerShell 6 (aka PS Core or pwsh) went a long way to be decoupled from WMF and have a life of its own, allowing a much higher release cadence and open-source development.

It's worth noting that the DSC DSL is still available in PowerShell 6...

The DSC Pull & Report Server was not really intented to be offered as a possible Configuration Management solution, but was offered as a **feature in Windows Server** so we could experience the Pull Mode, and start contributing and using DSC Resources.
I think that experience with the Pull Server was both what attracted people to implement DSC in their datacentre (it is a 'free' PowerShell Configuration Management Tool, minus the Windows license), and what frustrated most who implemented it early on in production (or wanted to, it's not a feature-rich 'Solution').

Against all odds, the last version of Windows Server was released with the much sought after feature to the Pull server: using a SQL Server backend. That said, it has been made clear that would be the last Pull Server microsoft would include in Windows (which means the feature will disappear in further releases). For a long time Microsoft has said that Azure Automation was the recommended approach for implementing the DSC Pull Model.

The DSC Resources have been doing well and are still actively developped by the growing community, some are looked after by Microsoft (DSC Resource Kit), and used on Windows by the users of many Configuration Management tools: Chef, Puppet, Ansible and of course DSC, but also in Azure with DSC Extension and Azure Automation DSC.

<h2>Intent and realignment of the DSC Team</h2>

Although it was clear that DSC needed to be decoupled from WMF as soon as PowerShell Core's project started even before becoming public, DSC's development did not stop and came to the same conclusion. However, it did not get the same publicity and openness as PowerShell Core. [DSC for linux](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerShell-DSC-for-Linux) already existed, but the tight dependency of the Windows DSC LCM with WMI means there is two code base and a lot of overhead (i.e. OMI) to be compatible cross platform and with the legacy (Who likes MOF, seriously...).
If DSC was to innovate, it needed to part from this old model, like PowerShell Core did.

The DSC team, then led by Mark Gray, started working on a new DSC LCM - hastly coined _DSC Core_ - and published the first DSC Planning update blog to explain the work in progress, challenges, and Philosophy.

The intent from then, and perdured by new Program Manager, Michael Greene, at the PS Summit and PSConfEU 2018, was to release the new version of DSC. Possibly Open-Sourcing it as early as they would be capable of, despite the increased effort required when developping in the open, as they learnt from PS Core.

But in June 2018, the almost-traditional re-org month at Microsoft, their effort had been realigned with the company's goal, which is both good and bad from a DSC User perspective, especially bad for on-prem users.
I recommend my previous post about [Understanding the new Microsoft](https://gaelcolas.com/2018/06/04/for-it-pros-understanding-the-new-microsoft/) to explain the motives and patterns, but in short refocuses on "Cloud First" with and agile development with continuous delivery for fast feedback - the Azure DevOps product (formerly VSTS) is a great example.

From then on, the purpose of the effort to develop an agent to configure the OSes from inside (as an autonomous agent) would be focused at helping Azure customers to manage their workload by extending Azure services or offering new ones.
It might seem like a high level change in words, because effectively the team is still developping a component that used to be called *the new DSC*, and that still leverages DSC Resources, but it's not.
It's a chasm from building a generic, standalone, cross-platform configuration platform, because creating a **new DSC is not the goal or purpose**, and is **not even in the roadmap**.

The goals, if I was to word it, would be something like:
- expose consistent auditing, compliance, and configuration interfaces to Azure Guests (i.e. VMs)
- support any OS offered on Azure
- enable multiple use cases (instances) without conflicting operations
- make it near-realtime, not WMI speeds...
- enable Infrastructure as Code principles
- do it at Azure scale for modern (albeit VMs) workloads

What that means for the work going into the new *native LCM* is to develop and use it actively for solving existing Azure challenges - some sort of eat your own dog food approach.
The sad part is that it's no longer the new DSC that we've been promised for a while, or what some - including myself - hoped from the name _DSC Core_ (since clarified): an updated LCM with feature parity, working on any OS, with new features and open-source.

Does that mean DSC is dead? Far from it, but it's definitely a setback for those expecting some features or a new LCM soon-ish.


It has the benefit to be:
- far less _theoretical_ than attempting to build a generic framework/agent
- support an untethered release and feedback cadence within Microsoft Azure
- enable iterative solution development that uses the components as they're developed, and develop them as they are needed
- Access to millions of machines, benefit from telemetry, and huge scale to solve modern use cases: a short and very valuable feedback loop
