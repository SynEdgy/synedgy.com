Watch this space for a list of our curriculums on:
- DevOps principles in Infrastructure management
- Configuration Management on Windows
- Desired State Configuration (DSC) and Release Pipeline
- PowerShell, Pipelines and Automation

We prefer mixing real-life implementation of technologies with the concepts and methodologies they support.
