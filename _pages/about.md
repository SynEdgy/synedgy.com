SynEdgy Limited offers Consulting services and works hand in hand with its customers to help driving Digital Transformation.

Based in London, UK, with international reach, we focus on Automation, Site Reliability Engineering, Platform Engineering (Cloud or on-prem), and DevOps practices.

We are convinced that Automation without a strategy often leads to automation sprawl, shifting the daily struggle to maintain automation instead of creating value. Automation sprawl hinders the **capability to change**, critical to businesses to adapt in continually evolving environments.
